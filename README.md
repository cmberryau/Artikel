A little iOS app for remembering German language articles

I started this a couple of months ago in my spare time as a reason to combine
learning German and iOS together. I've worked on it very little.
I've found the app actually quite nice to assist in remembering articles.. 
which I am usually terrible at!

The app allows users to enter words, and then test themselves. It has an
extremely basic and buggy system of picking the next word.
