A little iOS & Django app for remembering German language articles

I started this a couple of months ago in my spare time as a reason to combine
learning German, iOS and Django together. I've worked on it very little.
I've found the app actually quite nice to assist in remembering articles.. 
which I am usually terrible at!

The iOS app allows users to enter words, and then test themselves. It has an
extremely basic and buggy system of picking the next word.

The Django app allows users to register using e-mail addresses rather than
usernames like vanilla Django. The actual articles application is again
extremely basic.
